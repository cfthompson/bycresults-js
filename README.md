# BYC beercan results program

(Hoping to re-write our old PHP app entirely in javascript so we don't have to worry about code security in the hosting environment)

(Also hoping ChatGPT will do most of the work)


## The Plan:

* Put boats on github (minus contact info)
* AJAX input:
	* finish time
	* Spinnaker
	* optional new boat (phrf, length, furler)
	* Optional start time
	* Optional ToT params, ToD
* Implement search loop for boat, roller furler
* Math: Division, elapsed, tcf, corrected, roller furler, and spinnaker
* Divisional sort
* Submit race to PRO, store and display as “pending” race
* Store approved races in G Drive?
* Work out auth
